      Science fiction conventions are gatherings of fans of speculative fiction,
      primarily science fiction and fantasy, but sometimes incorporating the
      horror genre, as well. Historically, SF cons focused on literature, but
      many today incorporate or focus on other forms of expression, such as film
      and television, comics, anime, costuming, and games. These cons provide an
      opportunity for fans of science fiction to get together with the
      professional writers, artists, and filmmakers in the genre.

      The cons usually have a guest of honor, or even several (e.g., an author
      GOH and an artist GOH), discussion panels, readings, book launches,
      showings of anime, TV shows or films, game rooms, and entertainment (e.g.,
      filk is a music genre with a science fiction or fantasy theme).

      This site offers a sampling of SF cons around the U.S., concentrating on
      those that have literature- and science-related programming.
